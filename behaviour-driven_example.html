      Feature: Delivery partner creates an adjustment via a form
        - So that BEIS can generate accurate reports for SID
        - As a Delivery partner
        - I want to adjust actual spends and refunds in historic periods in line with agreed   corrections

        Background:
          Given an active report exists
          And I am looking at the Activity -> Financials tab

        Scenario: can create an adjustment for an activity
          When I submit the new adjustment form correctly
          Then I expect to see the new adjustment
          And the adjustment should not appear in the list of actuals
          And I can drill down to the details of the adjustment
          And I can navigate back to the associated activity or report

        Scenario must supply the required information to create an adjustment
          When I submit the new adjustment form incorrectly
          Then I expect to see how I need to correct the form
